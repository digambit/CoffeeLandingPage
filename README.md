# Coffee Landing Page [Mockup]

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I built a coffee-themed landing page called Coffee Love in this project.

I utilized flexbox and grid skills in this HTML and CSS-only landing page (although, I added a bit of JavaScript too). The layout shifts for mobile and tablet, which was a great way to practice my responsive skills, along with a tricky layout design for the hero.
